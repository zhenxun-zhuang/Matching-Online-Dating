# Predicting Matchings between Online Dating Profiles

This is my attempts for the in-class Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/cse512/data which aims at predicting whether there is a match between two online dating profiles. All features were obfuscated and normalized to protect the privacy of users so very little prior information can be applied. 

For the source folder, you need to first use 'data_prep' to nomalize the data, then choose any algorithm you like to train a predictor.
